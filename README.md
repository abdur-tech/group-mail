# group-mail

Project Idea: Asynchronous Email Sending Service
Description: Create a Django-based web application that allows users to schedule and send bulk emails. Instead of sending emails synchronously (which could block the main thread and slow down the application), use Celery to handle these tasks asynchronously.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their email lists.
Email Scheduling: Users can schedule when their emails should be sent.
Email Templates: Provide a simple UI for users to create email templates.
Task Queue: Use Celery to queue the email-sending tasks.
Asynchronous Task Execution: Send the emails asynchronously using Celery workers.
Task Monitoring: Monitor the status of the tasks (Pending, Started, Completed) using Celery's result backend with Redis.
Error Handling: Implement error handling and retries for failed tasks.
Dashboard: Create a dashboard to show the status of sent, pending, and failed emails.
Tools/Technologies:

Celery for task queues and asynchronous execution.
Redis as the message broker and result backend.
Django as the web framework.
SMTP Server (like SendGrid or a local SMTP server) for sending emails.
Flower (optional) for real-time monitoring of Celery tasks.
Learning Outcomes:

Understand how to set up and configure Celery with Django.
Learn how to use Redis as a message broker and result backend.
Gain experience in creating and managing asynchronous tasks.
Explore task retry strategies and error handling with Celery.
Build a real-time monitoring system for task queues.
